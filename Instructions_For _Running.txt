There are two folders: one for the backend and the other for the client.

To start the client application, navigate to the client directory by executing:
cd client and npm start

For the backend server, navigate to the backend directory using the command:
cd backend and nodemon server.js

Make sure to configure your MongoDB local server URL, typically mongodb://localhost:27017/
